# custom-euroscope

**A web app to patch EuroScope with new colours and icons.**

To use, go to [https://19wintersp.github.io/custom-euroscope](https://19wintersp.github.io/custom-euroscope).

The code in this is really, really bad, and I disown it entirely. You're welcome
to extract the Rust portions of this (which aren't so bad as the awful frontend)
to use them independently. Please don't kill me, Gergely.
